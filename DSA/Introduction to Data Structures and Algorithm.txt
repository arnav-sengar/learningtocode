Data Structures :
They are the ingredients to make efficient algorithm.
Arrangement of data so that they can be used efficiently in main memory(RAM).
Ex : arrays,linked lists,stack, queue etc.

Algorithm :
Sequence of steps to solve a given problem.
Ex : steps taken for sorting an array

Other terminologies :
1.Database : Collection of information in permanent storage(HDD) for faster retrieval and updation.
2.Data Warehousing : Management of huge amount of legacy data for better analysis.
3.Big Data : Analysis of too large or complex data which cannot be dealt with traditional data processing application.

Memory layout of C Program : 
When the program starts, its code is copied to the main memory.
Stack holds the memory occupied by the functions
Heap contains the data which is requested by the program as dynamic memory.
Initialised and uninitialised data segments hold initialised and uninitialised global variables respectively.
